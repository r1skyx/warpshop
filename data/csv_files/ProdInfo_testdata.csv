17374|1003265|THOUGHTFULLY DESIGNED, CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED: Measuring 16.5" head to toe, this plush lion toy features a variety of tactile fabrics - from soft and squishy to smooth and stretchy - along with pellet filled paws and embroidered facial features. Even after 40 years of crafting plush toys, we're always innovating with unique fabrics, stuffing and animal types. From realistic stuffed animals to animals extracted from our deep vault of imagination, we've made it all. 
17375|1003265|SOFTER THAN A CLOUD: Or a pillow, or freshly fallen snow. The best way to describe Toby the Lion's ultra-plush fabric body and mane would be to touch your screen - that's the opposite of how this stuffed animal lion feels. With our long history of sourcing the finest plush materials and knowing just where and how much to stuff animals, Manhattan Toy knows soft. 
17376|1003265|PROMOTES SELF-COMFORTING AND EMPATHY: The world can be a far less scary place for a little one with a huggable, comforting companion at their side. Pretend play helps develop empathy and social skill development as children imagine the world through other eyes. Caring for their furry friend is bridge building for later relationships with their not so furry friends. 
17377|1003265|A GIFT FOR ALL AGES OF LION LOVERS: Manhattan Toy knows that stuffed animals aren't just for kids. Beyond all of the soft and the cute there's usually some fun and whimsy - personality is always a huge design component. For a lion lover, or lovers of super soft stuffies in general, a Manhattan Toy stuffed animal gift is heartfelt and timeless. 
17378|1003265|STANDING BY OUR BRAND: If you're reading this, you've found a safe toy from a real company and a brand that cares.

Each model is created one at a time from the original mold, which is injected with a special resin selected by Breyer for its ability to capture the depth of detail, delicate feel and richness of color in our models.

23350|1004384|From the Napoleonic Wars to the American Revolution to the Civil War to the Plain Wars and many other conflicts in between, Black Powder covers a significant period in history spanning almost 300 years, which encompasses an era of warfare defined by muskets and cannons fueled by nothing more than gunpowder. 
23351|1004384|Reenact pivotal battles in history within this tabletop combat game using dice, troops, and rules constructed by Warlord Games against one or more opponents. 
23352|1004384|Each brigade is led by a single commander. You can move your entire brigade altogether or give individual units their own orders. On each turn, verbal commands are agreed upon by both players and moved based on those verbal commands and the roll of the dice. 
23353|1004384|Built to be played on large tabletops, such as a pool table and multiplayer with as many people as you want, Black Powder was originally created to be a club game. A standard move is 12 ins for infantry, 18 in for Cavalry. Each player will need to have a measuring tape handy as they are not included. 
23354|1004384|Build, paint and play! The construction and painting of the models and watching them come to life are just as much fun as the game itself!

From realistic stuffed animals to animals extracted from our deep vault of imagination, we've made it all. 
36002|1006751|SOFTER THAN A CLOUD: Or a pillow, or freshly fallen snow. The best way to describe Billy the Bunny's ultra-plush fabric body and floppy ears would be to touch your screen - that's the opposite of how this stuffed animal bunny rabbit feels. With our long history of sourcing the finest plush materials and knowing just where and how much to stuff animals, Manhattan Toy knows soft.

Even after 40 years of crafting plush toys, we're always innovating with unique fabrics, stuffing and animal types. From realistic stuffed animals to animals extracted from our deep vault of imagination, we've made it all. 
37648|1007056|SOFTER THAN A CLOUD: Or a pillow, or freshly fallen snow. The best way to describe how soft the Lovelies collection is would be to touch your screen - that's the opposite of how this pink pig stuffed animal feels. With our long history of sourcing the finest plush materials and knowing just where and how much to stuff animals, Manhattan Toy knows soft. 
37649|1007056|PROMOTES SELF-COMFORTING AND EMPATHY: The world can be a far less scary place for a little one with a huggable, comforting companion at their side.

37650|1007056|A GIFT FOR ALL AGES OF FARM ANIMAL LOVERS: Manhattan Toy knows that stuffed animals aren't just for kids. Beyond all of the soft and the cute there's usually some fun and whimsy - personality is always a huge design component.

52186|1009776|THOUGHTFULLY DESIGNED, CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED: Measuring 8.5" tall seated and 16" head to toe, this plush fox toy features a smooth, stretchy main body with a weighted bottom and embroidered facial features. Even after 40 years of crafting plush toys, we're always innovating with unique fabrics, stuffing and animal types. From realistic stuffed animals to animals extracted from our deep vault of imagination, we've made it all. 
52187|1009776|SOFTER THAN A CLOUD: Or a pillow, or freshly fallen snow. The best way to describe Fran Fox's luxurious, sewn-on fur shorts is to touch your screen - that's the opposite of how this stuffed animal fox feels. With our long history of sourcing the finest plush materials and knowing just where and how much to stuff animals, Manhattan Toy knows soft. 
52188|1009776|PROMOTES SELF-COMFORTING AND EMPATHY: The world can be a far less scary place for a little one with a huggable, comforting companion at their side. Pretend play helps develop empathy and social skill development as children imagine the world through other eyes. Caring for their furry friend is bridge building for later relationships with their not so furry friends. 
52189|1009776|A GIFT FOR ALL AGES OF FOX LOVERS: Manhattan Toy knows that stuffed animals aren't just for kids. Beyond all of the soft and the cute there's usually some fun and whimsy - personality is always a huge design component. For a badger lover, or lovers of super soft stuffies in general, a Manhattan Toy stuffed animal gift is heartfelt and timeless.

53034|1009933|7.5" FANTASMA MERMICORNO - One special night, a group of Unicornos were flying in the direction of falling stars. The falling stars were disappearing into a sparkly sea which transformed them into star fishes, while changing snowflakes into jelly fish. They rode the tail of a shooting star into the magical sea, turning them into enchanting creatures of half Unicorno and half fish. One day while following migrating dolphins, they discovered the surface of our world. Thus began the legend of the Mermicornos, rumored to only resurface during a lunar eclipse.
