2922|1000526|show up to 2 reviews by default Macroblade 84 ABT W addresses the biggest concern of most skaters...how can I stop? The ABT brake system provides control and stability for new skaters who need a little extra confidence and support when stopping. Traditional brakes work very well, but can be challenging for some to use. Skaters have to lift their toes up on the braking skate and roll on just a few of the wheels which creates some potential balance or fear issues. ABT, on the other hand, is cuff activated and allows the skater to slide their braking foot forward to keep all eight wheels on the ground adding stability and enhancing balance during the braking process. This results in a smooth, gradual braking motion which instills more confidence in the skater. ABT is also height adjustable so as the brake pad wears down, it can be lowered to enable the foot to slide forward the same distance every time for consistent stopping power and technique. The ABT system comes on the right skate but can be switched to the left one. Using the brake will be easy and comfortable because the Macroblade boot will blanket the feet in comfort and the wheel/bearing set is ideal for skaters to have the right amount of speed and control without going too fast.

3370|1000601|show up to 2 reviews by default The M8 Greyhound was originally designed to replace the US Military's portee gun in an anti-tank role, but was quickly repurposed once it was realized that its performance against German armor was lacking. It found use as a popular and successful armored car that served American and British armies throughout the war. Its crew of four served a 37mm gun, a Co-Axial . 30 cal, The more aggressive crews adding a . 50 cal on the roof for anti aircraft and local defense. It was very fast – hence its British name of greyhound – capable of 55mph on good roads, but was known to bog down in mud. Its armor was enough to shrug off small arms fire, and these vehicles were best used in pairs to Scout out enemy lines, supporting each other in a leap-frog fashion on the advance or covering a retreat. Replacing the armored turret for a fixed, open fighting compartment, The M20 Scout car was used primarily as a command vehicle, sacrificing the turrets main gun in favor of extra radio capability, It also carried a portable bazooka for extra anti-armor firepower.

Due to its small size, the a4 was able to operate off the smaller world War II era, Essex class carriers, but could still carry a useful payload to its target. The A-4 Skyhawk is a carrier-capable ground-attack aircraft designed for the US Navy and marine Corps. Skyhawk's were the Navy's primary light bomber used over North Vietnam. The Argentine air Force also used the Type during the Falklands war in 1982.

The last of the RAF's biplane fighters, the gladiator had some modern features, such as an enclosed cockpit, a first for an RAF fighter, as well as an armament of four machine guns. Still in service at the outbreak of the war, The gladiator proved to be a capable biplane fighter, but was outclassed against modern monoplane opposition. The mount of some The RAF's most famous pilots, such as pat pattle and Roald Dahl, preserved Gladiators can still be seen flying today at duxford and old Warden air displays.

8416|1001493|In this Trouble Disney Frozen Olaf's Ice Adventure game, kids move their real ice tokens through all kinds of adventures along the gameboard. The game comes with ice molds for making Olaf tokens. The plastic molds look like Olaf and his belly freezes into ice. (If there's no time to wait, kids can use regular ice cubes instead. ) Players take turns pressing the Pop-O-Matic dice roller and moving their Olaf token the number of spaces shown on the numbered die. The action die determines what obstacle Olaf must face, such as warming up the token in a player's hands, or even breathing on it! The last player with their Olaf token standing wins the game. The Olaf's Ice Adventure edition of the Trouble game makes a fantastic gift for fans of Disney's Frozen. Copyright Disney Hasbro Gaming and all related terms are trademarks of Hasbro.

8578|1001519|show up to 2 reviews by default A notorious gang of smugglers is recruiting new members. The first candidates step forward, a motley bunch indeed. Which one has the skills to become a worthy member of the gang? To determine this, the boss himself stages a smuggling contest. First the would-be smugglers must try to get through a hole in a fence while carrying the biggest sack of contraband possible. Then those who make it through the hole have a chance to inspect the other smugglers' sacks that are smaller than their own or that shamefully got stuck in the hole in the fence. A role of the die determines which size hole in the fence the sack needs to fit through. The smuggling sacks are formed from a rubbery polymer putty that the players roll into balls with the contraband pieces hidden inside. The balls are then rolled down a track toward the fence. The player's goal is to form the largest ball that will still fit through the fence. Players who succeed in getting the largest ball through the hole in the fence can then guess the contents of the smaller balls or of balls that were too large to fit through the fence. If they guess correctly, they get to keep the contraband. The player who collects the most contraband items wins. This funny family game answers the question: Who is the sneakiest and most skillful smuggler?.

9218|1001639|Cressi’s latest addition to its extensive line of world renowned fins is the Frog Plus open heel scuba diving fin. The Frog Plus features many of the great characteristics of a traditional paddle fin along with introducing a revolutionary new blade material that is both extremely durable and nearly indestructible. The Frog Plus utilizes Cressi’s patented three material injection molding process. The three materials consist of a nice comfortable rubber on the foot pocket that extends up the side rails of the blade. The second material is the revolutionary new dual density techno polymer which forms the blade, and in conjunction with the third silicone based material creates a channeling effect. The channeling effect is the characteristic of the fin that enables a high level of energy to be transferred in both up and down strokes of the kick pattern. The Frog Plus also incorporates Cressi’s patented positioning of the foot pocket below the blade. This design increases the working surface area of the blade by 20%. The combination of the channeling effect and the foot pocket mounted beneath the blade creates a very powerful and efficient fin with minimal leg strain. Because of these characteristics, the Frog Plus fin is an ideal choice for the entry level to advanced diver. The Frog Plus is designed and made in Italy by Cressi, a brand pioneer in Scuba Diving, Snorkeling, and Swimming equipment since 1946. The product is covered by a 2-year limited warranty.

Thoroughbreds can run approximately 35-40 miles per hour, and maintain that speed over distances of 5 to 12 furlongs (5/8 mile to 1.5 miles) Breyer Freedom Series celebrates everything there is to love about horses!

Studies have proven that, apart from language, creativity is the most important way for children to express themselves. Whenever they paint, do craft projects, build models or engage in pretend play, they work out emotions, experiences and learn to find their own solutions. Plus, they practice their fine and gross motor skills. Child psychologists, doctors and teachers recommend supporting the creative development of children. CALAFANT toys are easy to build, fun to decorate and wonderful to play with - for any child. All CALAFANT models are designed in Germany and made of high-quality, recyclable cardboard. All pieces are pre-cut, pre-punched, and can be put together without glue and scissors thanks to the CALAFANT Easy-Lock-System.

11744|1002076|Out of my way! Ben Banana is calling, the boss of the jungle monkey gang. At breakneck speed he leaps from one tree to the next. All other monkeys cannot stop gazing in amazement and suddenly he is lost from sight. On which limb is he sitting now? If you tweak the proper limbs in the jungle, you may annoy Ben and his gang heavily and pilfer their beloved bananas. But beware: only the player who has collected the most bananas will be the winner of the game. Up to four young players take charge of their gang of mischievous monkeys. All they care about is playing tricks on the other monkeys, trying to relieve them of their hoard of bananas. As the 3-D jungle offers many hiding spots you'll need a good memory to drive your opponents' monkeys out of the trees and snatch their bananas for your own crew.

It was supposed to be equal in performance but wasn't so successful. The construction was not the best and there were a lot of problems in the production process itself what made the plane full of flaws. Nevertheless, they were basic fighters of the Soviet air Force during world War II. The set includes a 5524 of the plane, a figure of a pilot and a block stand. This fighter has a rotating propeller, operable flaps and the pilots cockpit which can be easily opened to put a figure inside.

12283|1002172|What Our Customers Are Saying... These Kendamas are SICK!!!!! THESE ARE AWESOME!!! Did You Know the Kendama is a traditional Japanese Wooden Toy? The word 'Ken' means 'Sword' and 'tama' means 'Ball', translating to the 'Sword and the Ball'. This challenging novelty toy is the perfect gift and is all the 'Kraze' for youngsters worldwide. Competitions are popping up across the globe for this worldwide phenomenon. The kendama is comprised of 3 cups, one on the bottom of the stick, and one one each side. The 2 cups on the side are actually different sizes, making one of the cups more difficult to catch the ball with. Of course, the most difficult trick of all is to catch the ball on the spike. We are not affiliated with Kaleb, Zen, Tribute, or Sunrise Kendamas. While it may seem like a simple children's toy, the Kendama can entertain for hours as you try to master all of its difficult trick sequences

12482|1002213|Macroblade 80 ABT W addresses the biggest concern of most skaters...how can I stop? The ABT brake system provides control and stability for new skaters who need a little extra confidence and support when stopping. Traditional brakes work very well, but can be challenging for some to use. Skaters have to lift their toes up on the braking skate and roll on just a few of the wheels which creates some potential balance or fear issues. ABT on the other hand is cuff activated and allows the skater to slide their braking foot forward to keep all eight wheels on the ground adding stability and enhancing balance during the braking process. This results in a smooth, gradual braking motion which instills more confidence in the skater. ABT is also height adjustable so as the brake pad wears down, it can be lowered to enable the foot to slide forward the same distance every time for consistent stopping power and technique. The ABT system comes on the right skate but can be switched to the left one. Using the brake will be easy and comfortable because the Macroblade boot will blanket the feet in comfort and the wheel/bearing set is ideal for skaters to have the right amount of speed and control without going too fast.

Known for their functionality and beauty, each of our products is individually crafted from the finest quality materials. Complete your child's playroom with these contemporary and sophisticated Child's Chairs. They are perfect for little ones to use for schoolwork or playtime. Matching tables are available in a variety of colors, but they need to be purchased separately. Wipe with slightly damp cloth. Do not soak. Do not use soap. Dry immediately with cloth or towel. Do not allow to air dry. Product will warp if it is not dried immediately. Amazon.com From learning to hold one's head up unsupported to reading one's first complete sentence aloud, children face new challenges daily. Given the tremendous physical and mental growth that takes place throughout childhood, today's preschooler deserves a degree of comfort at the end of a long day of learning. However, conventional home furniture better accommodates grown-up bodies than petite frames, thus posing extra physical challenges for the child within the home environment. Lipper International has long considered the needs of young people with its extensive line of children's furniture, including this two-chair set. With a 100-pound weight capacity each, the chairs' 13-inch seat height enables children to crawl up and sit easily. The chairs suit children up to age 12. Made in Thailand, the chairs feature beech wood construction for durability throughout one's childhood and beyond. The chairs feature standard three-slat ladderbacks for ample back support. The FDA-approved, white-painted finish enhances the set's veneer, while also preventing splintering. To clean the chairs, wipe them down with a soft damp cloth and use a mild soap on marks and stains. Dry off immediately to prevent water damage to the wood. The set's design best befits indoor use. Upon delivery, some assembly is required. The chairs match Lipper International's 514 and 534 table and chair sets, and are also available in cherry, pecan, and natural. Each chair measures 13-3/4 by 14-1/2 by 25-1/2 inches. The set weighs 18 pounds upon shipping. --Jessica Reuling

15301|1002709|show up to 2 reviews by default From the Manufacturer These sleek, striped equids live in the savannah grasslands of eastern and southern Africa where they spend most of the day grazing on grass, leaves, bark, roots and stems. Each zebra's pattern of stripes is unique. The plains, or common, zebra sport wide stripes on their bodies -- that continue to the undersides -- along with thinner 'shadow' stripes on their hind quarters. Their excellent hearing and vision help them escape predators. They usually live in family groups of one stallion and several mares but often come together in large herds of several hundred zebras. And, once a year, hundreds of thousands of zebras gather to migrate in search of food and water. These herds sometimes mingle with wildebeests, ostrich and antelope. Zebras tend to be pretty skittish -- who can blame them with all the lions and hyenas around -- and really noisy. Their whinnies, yelps and barks are their way of communicating with each other. They never wander too far from a source of water and can live about thirty years in the wild.

15473|1002740|Kick start your child's path to reading with Bob Books and Versatile Sight Words Set. The learning words and fun stories in Sight Words Set may be slightly longer and more complex than the Kindergarten set. However, Sight Words are common words and will appear again and again in your kid's reading material. Learning these words "by sight" is very beneficial and essential to their reading fluency. Sight Words Educational Game provides more practice by introducing another set of sight word. Alongside these books, kids can practice and apply the skills they learned by doing Versatile activities. This fun educational puzzle-like practice system creates a hands-on learning way of reviewing what they are learning in their Bob Books. It is a very easy way to learn, simply line up the answer case on top of the page in the book then line the tiles up on top to start. Afterward, pick up tiles 1-8 and answer the question underneath it. Once each tile is placed, close the case, flip it over, and see if the pattern matches what is on the bottom right corner of the page. This learning practice is what helps children comprehend what they are learning and gives them great confidence in their reading abilities. Includes 10 easy-to-read hilarious small books (12 pages each) with three new sight words introduced in each book (30 two-sided and sight words flashcards).

17441|1003096|In 1809, at the battle of Wagram, some Polish light horse fighting for Napoleon seized lances from Austrian Uhlan prisoners and used them with good effect. Impressed by their use, Bonaparte ordered nine regiments to be formed, six of them clothed in green and three in blue. With their nine-foot ash pole lances, red and white pennants, and topped off with gleaming brass classical helmets they cut quite a dash on the battlefield. Lancers were unusual as they could take their place in the battleline and fight it out with enemy cavalry or infantry, but they were most often used in scouting, raiding, and – especially in Spain and Russia – in skirmishing, even fighting dismounted where the situation arose. Armed with a wicked lance, sabre, and at times a carbine and up to two pistols, the French line lancer was a formidable foe! Contains: 12 plastic easy-build French Light Cavalry Lancers. 1 additional metal officer and metal horse. 1 additional metal bugler. Optional metal arm for eagle bearer. Although a standard unit size for French Lancers would be 12 in most games, this box allows you to make 13 mounted French Lancers, giving you the choice of fielding them with or without command models.

17540|1003111|WETA Workshop was thrilled to return to Middle-earth once again with the Hobbit trilogy, contributing design, Specialty props and specialty costumes to all three films. WETA Workshop authentic Collectables are made by the very same artists and technicians who work on our movies, using the same techniques and materials. Creeping unseen in the subterranean labyrinth beneath goblin-town, Gollum was a Nameless horror, Preying upon Goblin whelps straying too near his cold, black lake. Wearing his magical ring Gollum was the Lord of his Lonely underground fiefdom, invisible to rapacious Goblin hordes. For almost as long as he could remember he had dwelt here, alone with his precious in the dark, his pitiful life stretched by the power of the ring, until the day bilbo Baggins stumbled into his world. Lost and bewildered, the Hobbit had escaped Death at the hands of his Goblin captors only To blunder into an equally unthinkable peril when Gollum lays eyes upon him at the shore of the underground lake. But as plump and tender as he might appear, bilbo Baggins is not the easy meal Gollum is expecting. Kindling distant memories, The Hobbit engages him in a game of riddles, the prize being bilbos life. Only when Baggins poses his winning stumper does Gollum come to truly appreciate that he has lost far more than just a game of riddles...And his Rage and despair is terrible.

18905|1003354|STURDY, FRIENDLY, CURIOUS, HAPPY-GO-LUCKY MEET THE BEAGLE. The sturdy and merry little Beagle is one of the most popular dogs in the United States. A member of the Hound Group, Beagles are scent hounds, developed primarily for tracking game. Since they lived in packs for hundreds of years, they naturally enjoy the company of other dogs and humans. Beagles are intelligent, but as a result of being bred for the long chase are single-minded and determined, which can make them hard to train. Despite this, their happy-go-lucky nature and gentle disposition make them a wonderful family pet. Increase your rent by buying Toys for your dogs and upgrading them to Big Bones. Sounds easy enough until you get fleas, have an accident on the carpet, or worse yet, get sent to the kennel. So grab your token and advance to go Beagles. Who knows. You may soon be Best in Show or marching in the Dog Parade. Whatever happens, keep your wag on. For 2 - 6 players, ages 8 and up. Includes directions for traditional play and for the one hour version as well.

Measuring just 27 inches long by 31 inches deep by 43-1/4 inches high, its compact size makes it particularly useful for small balconies or other places where space is limited. The back and seat of the armchair slide together as a unit, which reduces the amount of space the reclining armchair needs overall.

20934|1003711|show up to 2 reviews by default Product Description Teaches place value, counting, addition, and subtraction Amazon.com The Dino Math Tracks game (winner of several prestigious awards, including an Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Gold Seal) is a race around the rainbow with a pack of pintsize, prehistoric pals. An unusual spin on a typical roll-the-dice-and-move game, it spotlights the mathematical concept of place value and gives kids reinforcement in what makes our base-10 number system tick. Each player is allotted one dinosaur for each of the four tracks (the tracks are labeled 1s, 10s, 100s, and 1000s). To play, a player rolls four dice to create a 4-digit number and then moves his or her prehistoric posse to the appropriate 1s, 10s, 100s, and 1000s places. Problem-solving strategies are honed as players scurry to get all four miniature mammoths or tiny triceratops into the dino haven, ahead of the other players' thundering herds. But look out! In the race to dino utopia, it's easy to get bumped by a baby brachiosaurus! The Dino Math Tracks game provides multiple levels of play for a variety of ages. At the simplest level (perfect for a first-grader who knows Arabic numerals and one-to-one correspondence), kids use only the place track for the 1s. Later, cards with simple problems are introduced ("Stuck in a tar pit! Move your 10s dino back two spaces!"). At the most advanced level, players might encounter a question like this: "Your 10s dinosaur forgot its pants, so it went back 15 to get them. Then it hurried forward 25. How far did it get? Move that many." Young players will find the 2-inch, spunky vinyl dinosaur playing pieces irresistible. The game offers plenty of opportunities for friendly competition and brain bending--not to mention lots of nonthreatening practice at addition and subtraction. --Julie Ubben See all Product description

23586|1004167|Size:22x32 This ready to hang, gallery-wrapped art piece features a vintage red car painted in watercolor. Founded in 2009 Naxarts vision extends beyond just creating and selling art. We believe that creating a contemporary living space has become more economically attainable for young professionals because of brands like IKEA providing a great selection of contemporary furniture at affordable prices. Art work, whether it is a painting, a photograph or a poster print, are an essential element of every modern space. But in todays market it is almost impossible to find unique and affordable art that will complement an individuals vision for his or her personal living space. We want to offer not only unique contemporary art to people who may choose to live in modern environments such as a small New York City loft or a modern family residence in L. A. , but also make it affordable to them. Giclee (jee-clay) is an advanced printmaking process for creating high quality fine art reproductions. The attainable excellence that Giclee printmaking affords makes the reproduction virtually indistinguishable from the original piece. The result is wide acceptance of Giclee by galleries, museums, and private collectors. Gallery wrap is a method of stretching an artist's canvas so that the canvas wraps around the sides and is secured a hidden, wooden frame. This method of stretching and preparing a canvas allows for a frameless presentation of the finished painting. Whether it's a contemporary, rustic, modern, or traditional style decor, Trademark Fine Art offers a variety of high-quality, carefully built wall art that will surely complement any style. We provide an abundance of art themes that range from fascinating abstracts to breathtaking landscapes.

Children are given all the instruction and tools they need to create their own Tree of Life painting, along with learning materials on Gustav Klimt and his contributions to art. The trick is in the specially designed tools that come with every kit and the easy to follow step-by-step instructions. No two Master Kitz are alike and each focuses on a different art technique. The Tree of Life Master Kitz kit focuses on ornamentation and includes the beautifully designed flowers and gem stickers which decorate the tree created by the stencil. The rest of the painting gets created with simple tools like stamps and acrylic paint. But there is plenty of room for creativity and no two paintings are ever the same. The great thing is that children as young as 4 years old can create right along with their 7 or 8 year old sibling because each kit leaves so much room for the young artist’s unique style to be expressed. The process is fun, educational and inspires them to keep creating! And the tools in the kit can be used long after the initial two paintings are finished. Use them in other arts and craft projects or use with other colors of acrylic paint and paper (not included in kit) to create an endless number of Tree of Life paintings. The finished project can be framed in any standard frame and makes a great gift mother’s day gift or holiday gift for grandma or grandpa. Master Kitz were designed in a classroom environment and each process tested for many years before becoming a commercial product.

26539|1004698|show up to 2 reviews by default The Hawker HURRICANE is a single-engine fighter built by the British. It was unique for the time because of its metal construction with partial canvas covering. Work began on this fighter in 1933 but not produced until 1937. By this time the plane turned out to be technologically outdated. The Spitfire, produced simultaneously, was much more modern. However, at the beginning of world war II, the HURRICANE was the basic RAF fighter, because of its simple construction and not very complicated technological process. Despite the outdated construction, its great advantage was the Rolls-Royce engine which enabled good performance during the flight. The set includes a 5518 of the plane, a figure of a pilot and block stand. The plane has a rotating propeller, retractable landing gear, movable flaps and pilot's cockpit which can be easily opened to put a figure inside.

Just like in the original Lowdown, players use skill and strategy to compete for the lowest score. Roll two color dice and two number dice, then use any combination of those to fill corresponding spaces in the grids on your dry erase board. Fill your spaces strategically -if you can fill a row of three using the same number each time, or with three numbers that add up to 10, you can cross it out and collect zero points for the entire row. The game ends when any player has completely filled two of their three grids, and the player with the lowest total score wins! This easy-to-learn twist on the classic game is great for travel and fun for the whole family. Perfect for 2 to 4 players, aged 7 years old and up. Includes six dice, four dry erase boards and four markers. Colors and decorations may vary.

27486|1004879|show up to 2 reviews by default The wall is a colossal fortification constructed millennia ago under the direction of Bran the Builder to defend the seven Kingdoms. Immense in size, the wall is built from solid ice and spans the realm at its Northern border. It is garrisoned by several structures along its length which are defended by the sworn brothers of the nights watch who maintain their headquarters from one of those structures, the remote and isolated stronghold, castle black. Members of the night's watch dress entirely in black and swear an Oath of duty and renounce all past allegiances and birthrights. Joining the watch and ‘taking the black’ also provides absolution for past crimes and immunity from any further punishment. Cast in heavyweight holystone and hand-painted, this highly-detailed piece captures the immense size of the wall and castle black in an unparalleled level of screen-accurate architectural detail at a scale and at a size that perfectly compliments our previously released Winterfell desktop sculpture. To create this iconic piece, HBO provided our designers with access to the original visual effects files used to create various props and sets from the series. In addition, scenes from the show were carefully scrutinized for fine details and nuances. A master pattern was then meticulously hand sculpted to create a truly immersive experience.

We believe that creating a contemporary living space has become more economically attainable for young professionals because of brands like IKEA providing a great selection of contemporary furniture at affordable prices. Art work, whether it is a painting, a photograph or a poster print, are an essential element of every modern space. But in todays market it is almost impossible to find unique and affordable art that will complement an individuals vision for his or her personal living space. We want to offer not only unique contemporary art to people who may choose to live in modern environments such as a small New York City loft or a modern family residence in L. A. , but also make it affordable to them. Giclee (jee-clay) is an advanced printmaking process for creating high quality fine art reproductions. The attainable excellence that Giclee printmaking affords makes the reproduction virtually indistinguishable from the original piece. The result is wide acceptance of Giclee by galleries, museums, and private collectors. Gallery wrap is a method of stretching an artist's canvas so that the canvas wraps around the sides and is secured a hidden, wooden frame. This method of stretching and preparing a canvas allows for a frameless presentation of the finished painting.

28299|1005034|Product Description Your favorite Kirby character is brought to life with these adorable designed plushies! These plush are made with high quality material to ensure a long lasting life. With it's awesome design and soft features, it is sure to excite any Nintendo fan! From the Manufacturer While Kirby has always had the ability to fly, Wing allows him to fly at a much faster rate. Wing specializes in strengthening Kirby's in-air capabilities and long ranged attacks. Although attacks like Feather Gun can take on enemies from far away distances, they still lack power. Wing has issues against bosses as many of the moves are short-ranged and have laggy endings, usually resulting in being directly on top of the boss and taking damage. Wing utilizes feathers and other such things as means of attacking. However, Kirby's new wings also allow for electricity-themed attacks that (oftentimes) can only be executed in mid-air.

28902|1005136|The Junkers jug 87G (Gustav) was a German dive bomber from the second world War. German propaganda created this aircraft as the basis of the luftwaffe's power. A very characteristic feature of the jug 87's were the W-shaped wings and special acoustic sirens operating during a diving flight. The frightening sound of sirens caused great panic among both civilians and soldiers. The G Series (Gustav) was designed for the destruction of tanks and armored vehicles on the eastern front. The Junkers jug 87G construction block model from COBI was designed for creative play but because of its faithful reproduction of minute details and historical significance, this will be a favorite of every aviation enthusiast and will enjoy adding it to their collection. The model of the aircraft has many moving parts including rotating wheels, moving ailerons and a propeller. At the controls and at the machine gun stand in special seats, two figures can be seated. The set includes a special display stand and a plate with the name of the aircraft, as well as a limited figure depicting the Ace of German aviation. This is the notorious pilot Hans- urlich rudel, whose character still raises a lot of controversy.

Each round, you associate one of your twelve color cards with a word card and start telling a story. After ten words and colors have been played, the scoring phase begins. Another player selects one of the visible words for you, and your task is to recall all of the colors played by the other players and yourself without looking. You earn points for correctly naming these colors. While this sounds difficult at first, through the stories The colors Become easier to remember. Farben is a Vivid storytelling game, which is completely unique to game design. Farben brings people together over the stories that they tell each other during the game!

Why, a palomino overo stallion named Big Chex to Cash, who has earned over $200,000 and several national reining championships. Foaled in 2002, Big Chex, who is owned by the 23 Partnership of California, seemed destined to become a reining legend. His sire, Nu Chex to Cash, earned more reining points than any other horse in American Quarter Horse Association history, and was the only horse to earn AQHA High Point honors in both reining and working cowhorse in the same year. Today, Big Chex to Cash stands at stud through Fappani Performance Horses in California. The stallion's first foals arrived in 2007, and hopes are high that they will continue their sire's winning tradition. Model measures 11.25"L x 9.5"H. From the Manufacturer Breyer is the maker of the world’s finest model horses! Since 1950, Breyer has brought a wide range of horse breeds from around the world to life for play and collecting – including real horse heroes like racehorse Secretariat, Olympian Valegro, and reining superstar Big Chex to Cash!

View larger Easily rotate the case horizontally or vertically for the best drawing position. View larger The Kids Drawing Easel for iPad by CTA Digital helps protect the iPad and safely bring the wonder of tablet technology to young children while inspiring their creative and artistic minds with a modern take on the classic easel. This 2-in-1 child-size drawing easel features a fun dry-erase marker board on one side and a special iPad holder on the other side for the touch of technology this generation's children will need for tomorrow and want to play with today. The easel legs can easily be adjusted to different height levels to keep up with growing children and comfortably suit their needs. The tablet holder in the center of the easel secures the iPad so it won't accidentally be dropped or misplaced by children and it can rotate 360 degrees to easily set to either portrait or landscape position. A dry-erase marker board can be found on the back for even more fun. View larger Get started right out of the box with the included eraser, dry-erase marker, and stylus. View larger The perfect size for any artist, adjust to three different heights at 2'4", 2'8" and 3'. View larger With the versatility of CTA Digital's Kids Drawing Easel for iPad, children can have a head start for tomorrow with one amazing platform that blends traditional and tablet activities for an enhanced learning and fun artistic experience. Designed for iPad and All Drawing Apps The unique iPad holder on the front of the Easel is compatible with the 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation iPad and comes with a drawing stylus that works with any iPad. There are dozens of popular drawing and coloring apps available that will work perfectly with the Kids Drawing Easel for iPad, including Draw Something, Nick Jr. Draw & Play, Doodle Buddy, Color & Draw for Kids, and many more that can be found in the Apple App Store. 360 Degree Rotating Case Once the iPad is secured inside the holder with the turning lock, the case can be safely rotated 360 degrees to set in either a horizontal or vertical position. This makes it easy to switch between portrait and landscape canvas orientations on the iPad. The rotating case makes the easel more versatile so it can work great as a stand to watch videos and movies or even have family skype calls with the iPad this way. 2-in-1 Activity Easel with Dry-Erase Marker Board Along with the special iPad case on one side, this multi-functional easel features a traditional dry-erase white marker board on the reverse side. So even when the iPad is unavailable or kids just want to have fun with markers, they can enjoy doodling and being artistic with this easel. It's also great for multiple children, so while one is getting creative coloring with markers another can play with drawing apps or games on the other side with the iPad case. Three Adjustable Easel Heights Kids come in different sizes and kids can grow and sprout quickly and unexpectedly, so it's good to know that this Easel can keep up with them for a while and work for children of different ages with its three height options. Parents can easily adjust between each level by simply unscrewing the legs and repositioning to one of the three available height settings. The three heights go from 2'4" at the lowest, 2'8" in the middle and 3' at the tallest height. The legs can also be removed entirely to use the easel on a tabletop if desired. Art Supplies Included The Easel comes with art supplies for kids to get creative right out of the box. A large crayon-like stylus for the iPad allows children to easily draw and color with their favorite apps. A dry-erase marker is also included and very easy to wipe away with its built-in eraser cap for erasing small areas and a larger eraser is also included to easily clear the whole board. These and other art supplies can be stored in the included art supply tray, which can be attached to either side of the easel. Turn your iPad into the ultimate drawing station.

After a small band of Middle-earth greatest heroes capture and tame some oliphaunts to help carry them out of hared, the new scenario in Race across hared pits them against the pack of wards and their riders who arrive hard upon their Heels. Even while their towering oliphaunts may give the heroes An early advantage, The heroes know they cannot ignore the warg-riders and their barbed arrows. Instead, their only hope is to quicken their pace and ride for the Ford of harnen where their massive oliphaunts might be able to crash through waters too deep for the wares to cross… Meanwhile, even as the scenario from race across hared brings this frantic Chase to life, It enhances your deck-building options With a new dúnedain hero, plus three copies each of nine different player cards. These enhance a wide range of the game's existing KEYWORDS, traits, and mechanics. You'll find support for everything from mounts to side quests and from the doomed keyword to the cycle's new focus on events that offer powerful rewards when you can target specific pairs of traits. This is not a standalone product. Requires a copy of the Lord of the Rings: The Card Game Core Set and the Sands Of hared deluxe expansion to play."

Additional equipment and supplies are required to launch the rocket, including launch system, model rocket engines, starters, recovery wadding, and glue (all sold separately). This rocket bulk pack has three individual packets, which allows each child to experience assembling and launching (with required components) the rocket and is suitable for youth group activities such as with clubs and schools.

Rocket engines come in a variety of sizes, time delays, and burn durations. A "first-flight" engine recommendation is generally made for each rocket kit. A launch pad has a stable base and a vertical rod that provide vertical stability during initial liftoff. A launch controller has a keyed ignition switch to prevent accidental ignition, and a cable provides a safe distance from the rocket during launch. Bulk packs of model rocket kits are available for clubs and schools, and allow groups of children to experience building and launching a rocket.

33307|1005925|Product Description Over 1 million sold! Quoridor is a multiple award-winning abstract strategy game. Try to get your pawn to the other side of the board. On your turn, you either move your pawn or place a wall. Can you successfully navigate the maze your opponent creates for you? Quoridor has become a standard among strategy games. Amazon.com A winner of many international commendations and awards, Quoridor Classic is a near-perfect game. Its objective is clear, not convoluted; the physical game is stylish, sturdy, and well made; and it has broad player appeal--it's great for families with players of varying ages. Quoridor Classic is a fast-moving strategy game that is similar to chess insofar as players move pawn-shaped pieces across the board. The difference is that there are wooden fences one erects to block the progress of and force a different route upon an opponent. The physical blocks are quite effective for discouraging daring moves, and encouraging more competitive players. Players utilize analytical and logistical thinking, as well as math-minded strategy. The game includes four pawn-shaped, smooth wooden pieces that are stylishly stained. The fences are natural wood. The playing board is made of heavy, carved wood that is richly stained and finished. Quoridor Classic accommodates two to four players. --Diane Beall From the Manufacturer The objective of the game is to advance your pawn to the opposite edge of the board. On your turn you may either move your pawn, or place a wall. You may hinder your opponent with wall placement, but not completely block him off. Meanwhile he tries to do the same to you. First pawn to reach the opposite side wins. It Includes 20 wood fence playing pieces, 4 pawns, wood game board and instructions.

It features 16-inch wheels, front and rear fenders, and removable training wheels. The coaster brake stops by pedaling backwards, which is an easy and safe way for children to learn to ride. Sized for young riders from 2 feet, 10-inches to 3 feet, 8-inches tall, the mini Bella is perfect for relaxed riding around the neighborhood, by the beach, or anywhere else on a paved path. The mini Bella is designed just like Firmstrong' s bikes for older riders with a classic, curvy cruiser design and a 9-inch durable steel frame. The 16-inch aluminum wheels feature 2.125-inch wide white-wall tires that roll smooth and easy as well as cushion the bumps as you ride over them freely. The wide, oversized seat completes your comfort with dual springs that help make the ride soft and cushy. Both the seat and the handlebars can be adjusted for height and tilt to properly fit the rider. It also features a guard to protect pant cuffs from getting caught in the chain and wide cruiser bike handlebars with high-density foam grips. The bike is shipped 80 percent assembled. Firmstrong has been designing high quality, affordable bikes for over 10 years with a focus on blending style and functionality to create a fun, adventurous experience for riders -- not just a mode of transportation.

34694|1006168|Style:Food Group Set show up to 2 reviews by default Set of 6 Food Group Themed Puzzles. Each Puzzle is 6 puzzles in one!! Colorful Cubes form 6 different real-photo images, each with beautiful pictures from 6 different food groups. Includes Fruits Puzzle, Vegetables Puzzle, Dairy Puzzle, Grains Puzzle, Protein Puzzle and Snacks Puzzle. Winner of the Tillywig Toy Awards, each side of the beautifully photographed solid wood cube puzzle is part of a different food group picture, so this is like getting 36 different kids puzzles in one set! Rotate the beautifully painted wooden cubes to assemble the 36 Nutrition Themed Learning Puzzles. The Real Life Learning Food Groups Cube Puzzle set includes 36 full-color fun facts flashcards. One side of each flash card provides a solution guide for the completed wooden cube puzzle, and the other side lists fun and educational facts related to the picture. The Food Groups Preschool Cube Puzzle is made from solid wood. Safety tested, lead-free paint (rather than stickers) is used to apply the pictures directly onto the cube, which means no peeling, and helps ensure durability for years of fun. Each side of the wooden puzzle features a slightly different pattern on the border, helping kids get the cubes all onto the correct side. And, every one of our kids cube puzzles within a category has a different colored border to make sure the cubes do not get mixed up! The fruit puzzle border is orange, the vegetable puzzle border is green, the protein puzzle border is red, the grains puzzle border is yellow, the dairy puzzle border is blue, and the snacks puzzle border is purple. Putting together puzzles helps to develop the ability to reason, deduce, analyze, and sequence, and directly effects logical thinking and problem solving skills. Physically, puzzles provide practice for hand-eye coordination and spatial awareness. In addition, the twelve 1.5 inch wooden cubes in the puzzle make great blocks for stacking, building and counting!

Who can get their teammates to say Pinball without being able to say Arcade, Game, Flippers, Tilt, or Roll? Not so easy now, is it? When playing the Taboo game, the obvious clues are strictly forbidden. Players race against the timer as they try to give creative and carefully-worded clues to get team players to guess words fast. But don't mention unmentionables, or it's time for the squeaker which means losing the point. Players can also play using the Game-changer die to mix things up. If it lands on One Guesser, only one teammate can guess on their turn. With 4 other possibilities on the die, players better be shrewd, quick-thinking, and willing to take some risks -- but don't get shut down by the squeaker!

Each of the two lights runs for up to 100 hours per battery set (2 AAs for the Blaze and 2 AAAs for the Superflash, included) and is backed by a limited lifetime warranty. About Planet Bike Planet Bike was founded in Madison, Wisconsin, in November of 1996. In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment first and foremost, with a dedication to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment. The people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose that seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25 percent of company's profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact. Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, the company strives to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short 10-year history, it has made a number of important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the four-line computer, which is now a standard in the industry, and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that started as a one-man operation more than a decade ago. While still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve its product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000. By 2010, Planet Bike has made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists.

37668|1006680|Skyrocketing to popularity during the South African World Cup, the Vuvuzela captured the attention of millions of soccer fans across the globe with its distinct sound and incredible capacity for noise. These instruments can output 120 decibels of sonic power, so if you need to be heard at your next sporting event, this is the noisemaker for you. Air horns run out, megaphone batteries run dry, but as long as there's breath in your lungs, this stadium horn won't be silenced. Perfect indoors and out, on the soccer pitch, in the football stadium, or on the sidelines at a rowing or cross country event. You'll be heard! This horn measures 26" long and is 4.5" at its widest. Typical vuvuzelas are a single piece of plastic, but this improved collapsible design not only allows for easier storage, as it collapses down to just 14", but also offers the ability to change up the normal pitch. Constructed with sturdy, thick plastic and available in four bright colors, match them up with your favorite teams and get ready to get loud.

38115|1006760|Amazon.com Potentially a permanent fixture in the homes of puzzle enthusiasts, this challenging pastime consists of a solid-backed oak frame and 14 oak pieces of varying sizes and shapes that slide around within it. One of the pieces is narrower than the others and can easily slip through a slot located in the lower, right-hand corner of the frame. Far less easy is maneuvering the Chosen Piece there. The object of the puzzle--of which there are a dozen variations of increasing complexity (43 moves for the first, 263 moves for the last!)--is to deduce which pieces need to slide where so that the logical route for the thin piece reveals itself. If you just can't figure some of the puzzlers out, solutions are available for $5 through a California address. --Tom Keogh From the Manufacturer It's twelve games in one! This unique sliding block puzzle offers a dozen different challenges that will supply hours of puzzling entertainment. The object is to maneuver the largest square out through the slot at the bottom without removing, lifting or turning any of the pieces. With each puzzle you solve, the difficulty increases. Solving all twelve is a challenge for any puzzle enthusiast.

One player is the “customer,” and the rest of the players are "salesmen" trying to convince the customer to purchase their product over the others. The products to sell are made by combining two of the Word cards, and players have to gear their sales pitch to the customer's character. Selling a snow machine to a caveman would be quite different from selling one to a rock star! Lie, fib, and make up some ridiculous stories in order to collect the most Customer cards. After each player has been the customer once, the player with the most Customer cards wins! Original Game by Jeff Ochs and Patricia Hayes Kaufman.

40714|1007218|The Imomushi silkworms can live only in the cold peaks of the Akaishi Mountains, and they produce the most delicate and expensive silk in the world. Very few people can withstand the hardships of the lonesome life a shepherd of giant silkworms leads. It is a solitary existence that requires great dedication and strength of character to bear the pressures that stem from competing with the few other shepherds who fight over the scarce but desirable feeding grounds, while keeping the fearsome ookamy at bay. Silk is a gateway game into area control and worker placement systems. Players have to move their silkworms to the optimal spaces so they can feed on the best grass available, while pushing the other players' pieces into less desirable feeding grounds. In this game, players roll dice in order to determine which actions they are allowed to perform during their turn. There are six types of actions available: breeding more silkworms, moving the shepherd or their mastiff, building fences or farms, moving the ookami monster around the board, and — most importantly — getting your silkworms to feed. When silkworms feed, they generate a number of silk points, depending on the type of terrain they are standing on at that moment. These points can be used to modify the outcome of a dice roll, all while keeping in mind that the player with the most silk points at the end of the game wins!

42163|1007463|Macroblade 84 ABT addresses the biggest concern of most skaters...how can I stop? The ABT brake system provides control and stability for new skaters who need a little extra confidence and support when stopping. Traditional brakes work very well, but can be challenging for some to use. Skaters have to lift their toes up on the braking skate and roll on just a few of the wheels which creates some potential balance or fear issues. ABT, on the other hand, is cuff activated and allows the skater to slide their braking foot forward to keep all eight wheels on the ground adding stability and enhancing balance during the braking process. This results in a smooth, gradual braking motion which instills more confidence in the skater. ABT is also height adjustable so as the brake pad wears down, it can be lowered to enable the foot to slide forward the same distance every time for consistent stopping power and technique. The ABT system comes on the right skate but can be switched to the left one. Using the brake will be easy and comfortable because the Macroblade boot will blanket the feet in comfort and the wheel/bearing set is ideal for skaters to have the right amount of speed and control without going too fast.

42917|1007586|In BATMAN BEGINS, we're introduced to Bruce Wayne's first incarnation of the BATMAN suit. Created by the Applied Sciences Division of Wayne Enterprises, this raw and intimidating design becomes an integral part of building the legend of The Dark Knight on the streets and rooftops of Gotham City. At UDReplicas, we have faithfully rendered the sleek, bevel-edged anatomy of this first bat suit with the same attention to detail found in our version of the suit's successor as seen in the film The Dark Knight. As with all our screen-accurate replica motorcycle suits, we painstakingly work with the original screen suits to capture their unique designs in form-molded leather. With this latest offering, we were fortunate to work with Brian Best, the craftsman at Shepperton Studios in England who supervised the mold design and model-making workshops that created the on-screen suits for BATMAN BEGINS. The result of this collaboration is obvious in every detailed angle of the sculpted armor and is sure to please any fan who demands the utmost in accuracy. Grade A cow hide leather.. Jacket and pants zip together at waist, essentially making this a one-piece body suit.

The softboot is going to offer a great fit while providing comfort for long skate sessions. To give the softboot the proper amount of support is the stability plus cuff adding great power transfer from your foot to the skate. The quick lace literally makes short work of getting your skates on, and holds tight and secure while skating. Another added benefit of a quick lace system is how fast you can go from skate to slipper after a hard skating session.

43030|1007608|Macroblade 84 ABT W addresses the biggest concern of most skaters...how can I stop? The ABT brake system provides control and stability for new skaters who need a little extra confidence and support when stopping. Traditional brakes work very well, but can be challenging for some to use. Skaters have to lift their toes up on the braking skate and roll on just a few of the wheels which creates some potential balance or fear issues. ABT, on the other hand, is cuff activated and allows the skater to slide their braking foot forward to keep all eight wheels on the ground adding stability and enhancing balance during the braking process. This results in a smooth, gradual braking motion which instills more confidence in the skater. ABT is also height adjustable so as the brake pad wears down, it can be lowered to enable the foot to slide forward the same distance every time for consistent stopping power and technique. The ABT system comes on the right skate but can be switched to the left one. Using the brake will be easy and comfortable because the Macroblade boot will blanket the feet in comfort and the wheel/bearing set is ideal for skaters to have the right amount of speed and control without going too fast.

43398|1007674|The Vought F4U Corsair was an American fighter plane produced between 1942 and 1952. It was used by the us air force. Because of the big diameter of its propeller and the need to avoid lengthening the chassis, they utilized wings that would fold in. This helped tremendously because of limited amount of space on board the aircraft carriers. This unique block plane has rotating flaps, retractable landing gear, cockpit with figure, rotating propeller and folding wings. You will also find a figure of a pilot and a stand constructed of blocks.

44574|1007886|Dominion, that’s what you’re trying to achieve. This time with animals! They each have a lesson to teach, whether it’s how to spit really far, or what kind of grass tastes the best. It’s a lot to keep track of, but you’re like an elephant: you remember everything. And you’re afraid of mice. You’ve taken up riding. Horses are intimidating; they say you can lead a horse to water, but you haven’t managed it. So you’re working your way up, starting with dogs. So far so good; the dog hasn’t bucked you off yet. Your menagerie got off to a poor start, with just a goat, two rats, and the advisor who suggested starting a menagerie. You couldn’t get that fox you wanted, but it was probably bad anyway. Now you’ve got some camels, which are just as useless for sewing as you’d been warned, and a turtle that can hold its breath for longer than anyone can stay interested. Soon the animal kingdom will be yours. This is the 13th expansion to Dominion®. It has 400 cards, with 30 new Kingdom cards. There are Horses that save a draw for later, Exile mats that cards can be sent to and rescued from, and Ways that give Actions another option. Events return. Dominion: Menagerie is an expansion, and cannot be played by itself; to play with it, you need the Basic cards and rulebook (Dominion provides both). Dominion: Menagerie can also be combined with any other Dominion expansions you have. We hope you enjoy this expanding world of Dominion!

45639|1008072|Buzzy Beetles (or simply Buzzy) are turtle-like creatures with hard, outer shells that are often blue. Buzzy Beetles will hide in their shells if jumped on, and, like a Koopa Shell, can be kicked to eliminate more enemies. The shell of the Buzzy Beetle is strong enough to resist fireballs and as such, they cannot be defeated by fire. In a way, they are the polar opposite of the Spinies; enemies who are immune to jumps, but vulnerable to fireballs.

Details: Length: 30.7" Width: 7" Height: 11" Position: Standing Age Group: The Recommended age for Hansa animals is 3 and up to comply with ASTM93 safety standards. Portraits in Nature is a hand-crafted collection of realistic plush animals. Artists working in a socially responsible and environmentally responsible studio create each Hansa animal from portraits of the creature in its natural habitat. Artisan hand sew the animals "inside out", an old world tradition that results in the minimization of seams, and their bodies are carefully "sculpted" to create "musculature" and "features" like movement in a walking or sitting position that are unique to each creature. On average, there are 42 separate pieces required to make each animal, that must be combined by a team of truly creative artists to create the distinctly realistic features that characterize HANSA animals. (Some animals have as many as 240 different parts!) Each animal is individually hand sewn, to give it a unique "personality", there are more than 860 different fabrics and man-made furs from which the "coat" and "hides" are made, along with over 6000 sets of different eyes, whiskers, claws, noses, and related accessories allocated for creating these wonderful plush animals. Stuffing emphasizes careful attention to the placement of the highest quality man-made materials.

47707|1008436|This is a great art kit for the young budding artist. Children are given all the instruction and tools they need to create their own Starry Night masterpiece, along with learning materials on Vincent van Gogh and his contributions to art. The trick is in the specially designed tools that come with every kit and the easy to follow step-by-step instructions. No two Master Kitz are alike and each focuses on a different art technique. The Starry Night Master Kitz focuses on active brush stroke and includes the Van Gogh roller which allows children to create this same effect in their painting. The rest of the painting gets created with simple tools like stencils and oil pastels. But there is plenty of room for creativity and no two paintings are ever the same. The great thing is that children as young as 4 years old can create right along with their 7 or 8 year old sibling because each kit leaves so much room for the young artist&rsquo;s unique style to be expressed. The process is fun, educational and inspires them to keep creating! And the tools in the kit can be used long after the initial two paintings are finished. Use them in other arts and craft projects or use with other colors of acrylic paint and paper (not included in kit) to create an endless number of Sunflower paintings. The finished project can be framed in any standard frame and makes a great gift mother&rsquo;s day gift or holiday gift for grandma or grandpa. Master Kitz were designed in a classroom environment and each process tested for many years before becoming a commercial product.

48308|1008541|show up to 2 reviews by default Join Art In History and explore the Civil War; which resulted from a difference of opinion regarding slavery, a key issue of the war. Two very different cultures within the various states (North & South) tested the system the founding fathers created. The Northern States were industrialized while the Southern States were mostly agriculture. The two factions had differing views in how they should be governed. The North favored a national federal central government, while the Southern States favored a regional government protecting states' rights. Furthermore, the southern states believed they should be able to nullify any federal laws they did not like. These differences, along with opposing views on slavery, eventually fueled the U.S. Civil War. One of the slaves' prized possessions (both in life and death) were their face jugs. Each one formed individually, they were made to be used as a container primarily for drinking liquids. Most slaves were not allowed to place headstones on their graves, so in addition the face jugs also served as a grave marker. Proudly Made In America.

51142|1009043|Product Description Pedal into learning fun with the Fisher-Price Think & Learn Smart Cycle, where kids are in control of all the action and the more kids pedal, the more they can learn! Smart Cycle is equipped with Bluetooth Technology, so kids can play cool games on a tablet or TV screen for a fully immersive experience! (Check list of compatible devices below.) Games focus on skills preschoolers will need as they head into kindergarten—here's just a start of what they can learn: Letters & Phonics: Games like "Alphaballoons" prompt kids to find the starting letter of items they see on screen ("Buh-buh-ball!") As your child gains success, the words get trickier, which helps keep them growing. Spelling & Vocabulary: Kids can fly a drone in "Drone Zoom" to collect syllables and spell words or hit a target letter with a beach ball in "Balloon POP!" to spell words in Seaside Village. Sound like fun? It is—and it's also setting up a foundation for reading! Reading & Rhyming: Whether they're sorting & categorizing rhyming words at the factory, or finishing sentences in the "Match-A-Word" game, they're pedaling, steering and playing their way to becoming readers! Get the fun started by downloading the free Smart Cycle Mission to Tech City app, using your tablet or media streaming device (See list of compatible devices below). Then your little gamer can choose one of three destinations and which games they want to play. With more than 15 different levels of play, the Smart Cycle automatically adjusts content as your child learns. Remember, the faster they pedal, the faster the on-screen action—so get those legs moving! Download additional Smart Cycle apps, featuring characters from some of your child's favorite Nickelodeon shows, for even more high-speed learning fun focusing on different subjects. (Tablet, TV, and media streaming device not included.) Brand Story To give your child the best possible start in life, you don’t have to have all the answers or do things a certain way. All you have to do is the best you can, and let your kids play. At Fisher-Price, we’re dedicated to helping you do just that by working tirelessly to bring you the very best gear and toys. Fisher-Price toys are made to help all kids—from infants to toddlers to preschoolers—develop through play, in their own ways, because that’s how they learn best at each age and stage. And for babies, our gear offers simple solutions (more sleep, anyone?!) you can’t possibly parent without.

Along with its unique scenario, which features quests decks for the players and for the Corsairs, flight of the Storm caller introduces a new leadership hero and three copies each of ten different player cards. Altogether, its sixty new cards carry players far across uncharted waters, support decks designed to run with fewer than three heroes, reinforce the enduring strengths of the gondola trait, and boast a handful of unique allies and events that plunge us deep into the cycle's new themes and mechanics. This is not a stand-alone deck. A copy of the Lord of the Rings: The core Set and the Lord of the Rings: The grey havens are required to play.

Her part wasn’t to question." escalation is the third data pack in the flashpoint cycle for Android: netrunner, and its sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty different cards) explore new Angeles in the wake of the twenty-three seconds incident. The city has plunged into chaos. The chaos has LED to rioting. Amid the rioting, people have died. Some died on the streets, in Bloody encounters with prisec. Some died quietly, targeted by assassins. Some simply disappeared. Yanked off the Grid in an age when the act of skirting surveillance and the ever-present Network is nearly not completely—impossible. Carrying US deeper into this chaos and the tensions pulling new Angeles apart at the seams, escalation offers a look at Corps more aggressively locking down their assets and hunt down their Rivals. Runners gain new decoders and new incentive to uncover and reveal the Truth of the Corps' activities. But amid the escalating tensions, if the runners hack the Corps, can they still survive? there's plenty of meat damage, net damage, and brain damage on the menu, along with cards that make utter trash of the runner's Rig and stack. Finally, escalation unveils two new, aggressively-minded identity cards—one for jinteki, and one for the anarchs that started the whole mess. / 4 ounces (View shipping rates and policies)

52778|1009315|The Tirpitz was a well-known German battleship from Wwii that was launched on April 1, 1939. It is a Twin to another well-known battleship, the Bismarck. The ship was deemed combat ready in September 1941 and was sunk on November 12, 1944 Near the Norwegian tromsø by the British air Force. Called operation catechism, a force of 32 lancasters dropped 29 Tallboys on the ship, With two direct hits and one near miss. This historically accurate block model from COBI is faithfully reproduced 1: 300 scale. It has nearly 2, 000 blocks and is 84.5 cm (33.25") long. It accurately reflects the proportions of a historic ship and preserves all its essential elements, including the original camouflage. It has numerous movable parts such as propellers, rudders, rotating towers and gun barrels that can be raised and lowered. The set also contains a very stable and aesthetic, black display stand with a plate on which the name of the ship is printed. Because it is a large and quite complex model, we recommend it mainly to veteran collectors and older, experienced block fans. It does not require gluing or painting, Because its entire body and all elements consist of construction blocks.

Command your flotilla of small ships as they head out to attack a convoy, drop off Commandoes for a behind-the-lines mission or task them with one of the other myriads of missions this small and versatile craft would perform. Be it the Coastal waters of England or across the Channel to France, on to the Mediterranean waters or on further to the vast Island chains of the Pacific, Cruel Seas will ensure your small ships see plenty of adrenaline-fueled action. The powerful US Patrol Torpedo boats epitomize American know-how and firepower. The boats built by Higgins & Elco companies first saw service helping fight off the surprise Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor, where they shot down enemy aircraft with the four large caliber Browning machine guns. These boats were built principally of wood and were fast and maneuverable as a result. They served in the European Theater, the English Channel, the North Sea, the Mediterranean and in numbers in the Pacific generally hunting down small Japanese coasters and sampans.

55219|1009735|show up to 2 reviews by default Macroblade 84 ABT addresses the biggest concern of most skaters...how can I stop? The ABT brake system provides control and stability for new skaters who need a little extra confidence and support when stopping. Traditional brakes work very well, but can be challenging for some to use. Skaters have to lift their toes up on the braking skate and roll on just a few of the wheels which creates some potential balance or fear issues. ABT, on the other hand, is cuff activated and allows the skater to slide their braking foot forward to keep all eight wheels on the ground adding stability and enhancing balance during the braking process. This results in a smooth, gradual braking motion which instills more confidence in the skater. ABT is also height adjustable so as the brake pad wears down, it can be lowered to enable the foot to slide forward the same distance every time for consistent stopping power and technique. The ABT system comes on the right skate but can be switched to the left one. Using the brake will be easy and comfortable because the Macroblade boot will blanket the feet in comfort and the wheel/bearing set is ideal for skaters to have the right amount of speed and control without going too fast.

55552|1009787|This is a 1/35 Plastic German 38cm Assault Mortar for Sturmtiger. This kit is recommended for age 10 and up. A very rare variant of the much feared Tiger I heavy tank, was the "Sturmtiger" assault weapon that mounted a gigantic 38cm caliber mortar on the tank chassis. Development was initiated in August 1943 and was intended for use against heavily fortified areas. The short barreled L/5. 4, type RW61 mortar was originally developed by Rheinmetall-Borsig, for the German navy's land-based protection against an enemy submarine attack. In order to withstandthe heavy recoil of up to 40 tons, the Tiger I's sturdy chassis was selected. A decision was made to use only those chassis/hulls that were sent back from the front, so that new production of the tank would not be affected. A lighting compartment was formed of a box-like superstructure which was bolted to the lower hull itself. FEATURES: Detailed plastic parts attached to sprues and molded in light brown and black. Highly accurate static display model. One lifelike crew figure with realistic expression. Detailed molded track lines. Realistically reproduced exterior and interior. Ammunition rack included. 38cm rockets and other weaponry included. Loading crane located at rear of tank. Shovel located on side of tank. Waterslide decals.

55908|1009847|show up to 2 reviews by default From the Manufacturer The ancient Galactic Realm, ruled from the Core Worlds of the galaxy, is waning. Now, the barbaric kingdoms that lie beyond the galactic frontier are amassing their strength, choosing this pivotal moment to strike at the heart of the fading republic, establishing new empires built upon the ashes of decaying civilizations. But these outer systems are not yet strong enough to engage the forces of the Core Worlds directly. The young kingdoms must first gnaw at the edges of the crumbling frontier, developing new types of units and shrewder tactics. They must build up their energy resources to launch magnificent fleets and overwhelming ground forces. Then, when the time is right, they must strike at the galactic core itself, claiming the most exalted planets for themselves. Core Worlds is a deck-building card game for 2-5 players. Each player controls a barbarian Star Empire represented by many cards. Throughout the game, players will invade Worlds and draft new Units and Tactics into their Empires. Each card lists its Empire Points in the upper right corner. The player whose Empire contains the most Empire Points at the end of the game is the winner.

55924|1009849|Without the brilliance of Technicians, the Star Wars galaxy would be unrecognizable. Their work has created sentient artificial beings, put the most distant systems within reach via hyper drive, and defined the ways that wars are fought. Yet even with such advanced technological marvels, there is no replacement for good, old-fashioned, spur-of-the-moment ingenuity, particularly in the Outer Rim. There, Technicians must be as resourceful as they are intelligent, in order to invent solutions for the myriad troubles they daily face.  Special Modifications, a sourcebook for the Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying game, brings new specializations and signature abilities to the Technician career. Its 96, full-color pages also include new playable species and copious amounts of gear including cybernetics, slicing tools, construction tools, and remotes. The book also features detailed guidelines for crafting devices, weapons, and droids of your own invention, as well as new slicing actions and expanded rules for running slicing encounters in your roleplaying adventures..

Barbie doll and her friends really move with motorized ponies, cars and scooters -- and they stay on track for play set storytelling. Barbie On the Go small doll is taking her car for a spin to the car wash. The Barbie On the Go car wash track set has everything you need to let your imagination ride! There's a motorized convertible -- battery power helps it drive on its own -- 10 track pieces (that you can configure any way you like) and accessories that feature nine surprise actions triggered when Barbie doll passes by in her car. Barbie small doll has flexible hips and knees that allow her to sit in the seat, plus a bobble head that adds realism and inspires giggles. To get started, simply push the Barbie license plate on the back of the convertible; the battery-powered motor starts, and the car starts rolling. Set Barbie doll and her vehicle on the track. The motorized action is so cool! The 10 colorful track pieces (and a palm tree) can be configured in multiple ways. Just snap them together and place the accessories to create a course. Moving accessories, like a gate, traffic light, stop sign and service menu, swing when Barbie small doll passes by in her car. There's also a framed car wash (with rolling washers), and a checkout stand with gate. A bench and a drink help play out waiting, and sunglasses are the perfect accessory for a California girl! Move the pieces around to tell so many stories. And collect other dolls and vehicles in the line to expand the story possibilities or add other play sets to expand the world (each sold separately, subject to availability). The Barbie On the Go sets are designed to work together to add to the fun! Includes Barbie On the Go Doll wearing sunglasses, battery-powered convertible, 10 track pieces and accessories.

56392|1009933|7.5" FANTASMA MERMICORNO - One special night, a group of Unicornos were flying in the direction of falling stars. The falling stars were disappearing into a sparkly sea which transformed them into star fishes, while changing snowflakes into jelly fish. They rode the tail of a shooting star into the magical sea, turning them into enchanting creatures of half Unicorno and half fish. One day while following migrating dolphins, they discovered the surface of our world. Thus began the legend of the Mermicornos, rumored to only resurface during a lunar eclipse.

About Planet Bike In November of 1996, Planet Bike was founded in Madison, Wisconsin. In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment. Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact. Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000. By 2010, they have made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists.
